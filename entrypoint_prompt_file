        Make a windows script that
        a) installs dependencies
        b) runs all necessary parts of the codebase (in parallel if necessary)

        
        Avoid `start cmd /k` commands. just execute direct in the script

        Prefer Use call: The call command ensures that the batch file continues to the next command after executing a program.
